* About This Configuration
Hello, I am an amateurish programmer. In this repository, I want to dwell deep into emacs.
Originally quite disgusted at how most tutorials on emacs configuration are. I felt like a modularization approach suits me best.
Therefore, having learned from [[https://github.com/CSRaghunandan/.emacs.d][this configuration]], I resolute myself to dive deep once again into the most powerful lisp intepreter.
